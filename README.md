# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - SpaceX Capstone

##  Project Overview
This repository contains my final capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The goal was to predict the successful landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stages using various data science techniques.

##  Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Leveraging SpaceX API and Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using SQL and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Interactive Analytics:** Building interactive maps with Folium and dashboards with Plotly Dash.
- **Machine Learning:** Building and tuning classification models (SVM, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression).

##  Key Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **83.3%** on the test set using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
- Identified key launch sites with the highest success rates through geospatial analysis.
